1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **Connected Services** node and select **Manage Connected Services** from the context menu.

1. In the **Connected Services** tab, select the **+** icon for **Service Dependencies**.

1. On the **Add dependency** dialog, type `Power Platform` into the search box.

1. Select **Microsoft Power Platform**, and then select **Next**.

   If you aren't signed in already, sign into your Microsoft Power Platform account. If you don't have a Power Platform account, [Create a Developer Environment](create-developer-environment.md).

1. In the **Connect to Microsoft Power Platform** screen: select your developer environment.

1. In **Custom connectors name**, the value `WeatherSample_Connector` should already be set.

1. In **Select a public dev tunnel**, select the **+** icon.

   1. In the field **Name**, type `SampleTunnel`.

   1. Select **Tunnel Type**: **Persistent**.

   1. Select **Access** : **public**.

   1. Select **OK**.

1. Select **Finish**

1. Once the connected service is configured, select **Close**.

> **Note:** If you encounter an error stating that the `Swashbuckle.AspNetCore` package is not found, you may need to install it manually. Follow the steps below:
>
> - In **Solution Explorer**, right-click on the project (not the solution) you have created.
> - Select **"Open in Terminal"**.
> - Run the following command in the terminal:
>   ```
>   Install-Package Swashbuckle.AspNetCore
>   ```
> - If prompted, type **A** to accept all license agreements.
> - Once installed, try the previous steps again.


## ‚òëÔ∏è Task 3: Create a canvas app with the custom connector

When Visual Studio runs a web app and a tunnel is active, the web browser opens to a tunnel URL instead of a localhost URL.

1. Run your Visual Studio solution and start debugging.

1. When the browser opens, a warning page opens with the first request sent to the tunnel URL. Select **Continue**.

1. With the web API running, open [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com) in a new browser tab.

1. Select your developer environment in the upper-right corner.

1. [Create a blank canvas app](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/create-blank-app) with **Phone** as the format.

1. In the top menu, select **Add data**.

1. Search for and select the **WeatherSample_Connector**, and then select **Connect**. More information: [Add connections to your canvas app](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/add-data-connection)

1. Insert a button and drag it to the bottom of the form.

1. Change the button **Text** to *Load Data*.

1. Enter the following formula in the button's **OnSelect** property:

   ```powerapps-dot
   ClearCollect(weatherCollection, WeatherSample_Connector.GetWeatherForecast())
   ```

1. Insert a [vertical gallery](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/add-gallery)

1. Select the **weatherCollection** as the data source, and then change the layout to **Title and subtitle**.

1. Run the app. It should look like the following example:
