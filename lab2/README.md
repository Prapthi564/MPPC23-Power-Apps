### ☑️ Task 1: Create A Canvas App With Data From An Excel-File

In this task, you will:

- Create a Canvas App using Excel to App
- Customize galleries by using Power Apps Ideas to generate Power Fx formulas

#### Introduction To Excel To App

With Excel to App, you'll select an Excel file, create an app, and then run the app that you create. Every app created includes screens to browse records, show record details, and create or update records. By generating an app, you can quickly get a working app using Excel data, and then you can customize the app to better suit your needs.

When you upload an Excel file it generates a Dataverse table. With Dataverse's standard and custom tables, you can securely store your data in the cloud. These tables enable you to define your organization's data in a way that is tailored to your business needs, making it easier to use within your apps.

If your environment is in the US region and AI is enabled in your organization, the AI Copilot feature can assist in table creation by suggesting table names, descriptions, column data types, and headers, even if this information is missing from the uploaded file. When Copilot AI is used for table creation, the Copilot card is displayed to indicate that the table was generated by Copilot AI.

In this task, you’ll create an application with data from an Excel table.

### ☑️ Task 2: Create a Canvas App with Power Apps Copilot

In this task, you’ll create an application leveraging Power Apps Copilot.  This app will be used by field agents to browse real estate inventory and manage appointments for showings and the data will be stored in Dataverse.

> **Note:** Power Apps requires either a Microsoft 365 license or a free trial. Learn more about your licensing options. [Microsoft products include Microsoft Power Apps and Power Automate](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-apps/administrator/pricing-billing-skus/).

#### Task 2.1 Explore AI Copilot within Power Apps

> **Note:** Within this lab, notice that your results for data may vary from those within the screenshots and images throughout the lab. This is because Power Apps is using OpenAI to generate data for the lab that changes daily.

1. Make sure you are in the **Dev environment** in the Power Apps Maker Portal.
   
1. From the left-hand navigation, click on **Apps (1)**, then select **Start with Copilot (2)**.
    
    ![](../Media/bs43.png)

1. In the **Get started with Copilot** text field, enter the following **prompt (1)**:

    `build an app to manage real estate showings`

1. Click on the **filter icon (3)**, select **one table (3)**, and then click on the **Generate (4)** button.

    ![](../Media/L2TT2.png)

1. Once AI Copilot generates a table based on your prompt, review the table to see the columns that have been created as a starting point.

1. To view the sample data added by Copilot, click on the **three ellipses (⋯)** next to the table and select **View data**.
   
    ![](../Media/L2TT3.png)

1. In the text box, at the bottom of the **Copilot** pane to the right of the screen, type:

    **`add a column for client full name in Real Estate Showing table`** **(1)**

    Then, select the **Send** button.
   
 >**Note:** If column creation fails and you see an error like: "Sorry, something went wrong. Please try again, or share your feedback." It typically indicates an issue with Copilot itself. To resolve this, try recreating the table with the 'One table' filter applied. Set the table size to 'Small'. Then, retry your prompt to create the column.


 You'll see that Copilot has provided feedback that the table has been updated and you should also see the new column **Client Full Name** **(2)** added to the table:

 ![](../Media/L2T35.png)

8. Now type the following into the chat:

    **`add a column for client email to Real Estate Showing table`**

    Then, select the **Send** button.

    ![](../Media/L2T36.png)

> **Note:** New column has been added to the table displaying the client’s email:

> **Note** Remember that the data that is generated in your table may vary from the data shown within the table in the screenshots and images for the lab.

9. Now, let’s add a **Status** column within the  Real Estate Showing table. In the text box within the **Copilot** pane, type and send:

    `add a column for Status to the Real Estate Showing table`

    It may take a minute to load. Once it does, you'll see that the **Status** column has been updated to include the option for **Completed**.

    ![](../Media/L2T37.png)

10. Select the **Status** column name **drop down**, and select **Edit column**. Here, you can add the drop down options such as **Pending** and **Confirmed** if not already present, and then click on **Update**.

    ![](../Media/L2T2S10.png)

    > **Note**
    >
    > If your column choices are not the same as the ones shown in the screenshot - you can also use Copilot to add these choices:
    >
    > `the status choices should be Pending, Confirmed, Cancelled, and Completed`

    Select the **X** in the top right corner of the pane to close out.

    Let's try adding more data to our table and the existing columns.

11. Within the **Copilot** pane text box, type and send:

    `add 5 more rows of data`

    Notice that five more rows of data are added for each of the existing columns within the table.

    ![](../Media/L2T39.png)

    Now looking through your table, you should have a number of columns. However, for the sake of following the rest of the modules in this learning path - let's try and remove some of the columns that we won't be using.

    The list of columns that we will need going forward are:

    - ID
    - Address
    - Date
    - Time
    - Status
    - Agent Name
    - Client Full Name
    - Client Email

    Use what you've just learnt with the **Copilot Chat** window to adjust your table to match the above. Don't forget to reference the Suggestions section for help in case you need to remove a column, change a column name, or add a column.

12. Let's create the app now. In the top right corner of the screen, select the **Save and open app** button.

    ![](../Media/L2T40.png)

13. When the app first loads, a dialog may appear saying: **Welcome to Power Apps Studio**. If so, select the **Skip** button.

    You should now be viewing the app, that has been built for you, in **Edit** mode:

    ![The app is displayed.](./assets/L2T2S13.png)

14. To the left of the screen, select the **Data** icon from the navigation bar. Notice that a **Dataverse** table has been created by the Copilot and is now in the **Environments** section.

    ![](../Media/L2T41.png)

    > **Note:** Copilot is currently only supported for Dataverse. You cannot use any other data access point at this time.

    Let's try editing the table now that the app has been created.

15. Within the **Data** pane, hover over the table. To the right of the table, select the **ellipsis** (...).

16. From the menu, select **Edit data**.

    ![](../Media/L2T42.png)

17. The Edit Table dialog appears. Here's where you can come and add your own columns to the table, or modify existing columns.

    ![The edit table dialog is displayed.](../Media/edit-table.png)

18. Select the **ID** column header from the table.

19. From the drop-down, select the **Edit column** option.

    ![The edit column option is highlighted.](../Media/copilot-edit-column.png)

    In this example, we don't want the Data Type of the column to be a Single line of text. Let's change that.

20. Within the Edit column pane, from the **Date type** drop-down select **# Autonumber**.

21. Select **Save**.

    ![The save button is highlighted.](../Media/save-column.png)

22. Select the **Close** button in the bottom right corner of the **Edit table** dialog.

23. Notice that the table now says **Refreshed** within the Data pane.

    ![The refreshed table is displayed.](../Media/L2T43.png)

24. We have to modify the gallery in the application so that it displays the relevant data. Select the **Tree view** icon to return to the Tree view.

25. On the app main screen, click on **RecordsGallery1** displaying the **Real Estate Showings** and then select the edit button to put the gallery in edit mode.

26. Select the **Title** and set the **Text** value to the following formula:

    `ThisItem.Address`

27. Select the **Subtitle** and set the **Text** value to the following formula:

    `ThisItem.'Client Email'`

28. Select the **Body** and set the **Text** value to the following formula:

    `ThisItem.'Status (crcaa_status)'`

    A single record in the gallery should now look like this:

    ![](../Media/L2T44.png)

29. On the app main screen, select the **Form** control.

    ![](../Media/L2T45.png)

20. On the **Top** pane on the right, select **Edit fields** **(1)** drop down menu.

31. Now within the **Fields** pane, expand the **ID** **(2)** field.

32. From the **Control type** drop-down, change the type to **View text** **(3)**.

    ![](../Media/L2T46.png)

    > **Note:** Because we previously changed the ID field to Autonumber, we don’t want the users putting in their own number; Dataverse is going to autonumber it for us.

33. Now click elsewhere to come back to the Tree view.

34. Now, let's make a new request for a property showing within the app.

35. From the top of the screen, select the Play button.

    ![](../Media/L2T47.png)

36. Within the pane to the left of the app, select the **+New** button.

    ![The new button is highlighted.](../Media/L2T2S36.png)

37. Although you could modify the form to autofill the fields for you, we're going to do so ourselves to show that the app works.

38. Fill in the following fields with the information below:

    - Agent Name: < Your name >
    - Client Full Name: < Your name >
    - Client Email: < Your email >
    - Date: < Any future date >
    - Time: < Any future time >
    - Showing: Active
    - Property: 123 Main St
    - Status: `Pending`
    - Address: `210 Pine Road, Portland, OR 97204`

    > **Note**
    >
    > This address is one of the addresses from the Excel file in Module 1. The same file which we uploaded and turned into the **Real Estate Properties** table.
    >
    > Usually, you would have a lookup field to the **Real Estate Properties** table, but we're going to keep it simple for this lab.

39. Then select the checkmark in the top right corner of the screen.

    ![The checkmark is highlighted.](../Media/copilot-checkmark.png)

40. Now, select the **X** in the top right corner to close out of the app.

    If a dialog appears saying: **Did you know?**, select OK.

    Notice that the new request has been added to the list of requests to the left of the app.

41. From the top of your screen, select the **Save** button to save the new app you have created.

    ![](../Media/L2T2S36.png)

    If asked, save app name as **Real Estate Showings**.

42. Select the publish icon to publish the app

    ![](../Media/L2T49.png)

43. Generate a description using AI by selecting the **Create description using AI** button

    ![](../Media/L2T50.png)

44. Check if the description is correct. If not, correct it and select the **Publish this version** button. If yes, select the **Publish this version** button.
    > **Note:** The description may vary as we are generating using Copilot.

    ![](../Media/L2T51.png)
    
45. Exit the app to return to the Power Apps home page.
